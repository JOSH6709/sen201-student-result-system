Requirement Analysis

This stage identifies what the system should do.

The system must:
	•	Accept student name and matric number
	•	Accept student scores for courses
	•	Calculate total score
	•	Determine the grade based on the score
	•	Display the student results clearly

⸻

System Design

This stage explains how the system will work and its structure.

Design Details:
	•	Programming language: Python
	•	Interface: Console-based

Components:
	•	Input module: for entering student details and scores
	•	Processing module: for calculating total score and grade
	•	Output module: for displaying the results

⸻

Implementation

This stage is where the system is actually created based on the design.
	•	The code/program is written using Python
	•	The design components are converted into working modules

(No need to put code in SDLC section if your lecturer doesn’t require it)

⸻

Testing

This stage ensures the system works as expected:
	•	Valid student data is entered
	•	Grades are calculated correctly
	•	Results are displayed accurately

⸻

 Deployment

This stage makes the system available for use:
	•	The Python program can be run on a computer
	•	The project is uploaded to GitHub for submission

⸻

 Maintenance

This stage considers future improvements and updates:
	•	Support for multiple students
	•	Store results in files or databases
	•	Add a graphical user interface (GUI)
